# Planning

## General

Planning projects is difficult. Although when I was university I participated in many group projects, they did not prepare me for managing my own projects, especially when I started to have multiple projects at at time. Now I enjoy learning about planning and I wish I would have known these things a lot time ago. So, I will try to share what I know with you. It might take me a while to write this section, but for now you can also check out some of my blog posts on this topic at https://www.veronikach.com 
 


## Project management in Github

Next to managing code, you can also use Github to manage your project. In the web interface, your repository should have a “Projects” tab. There is a list of projects here. It is possible to have multiple projects for a single repository. This is helpful, for example, if you are working with multiple students on the same code, but you each have your own project/planning.

A project consists of columns (like “todo”, “in progress” and “done”) and cards. A card can be a task you need to do. 
A card can be made in two ways:

* Creating an issue on Github, which automatically adds a card to the "todo" column. An advantage of this is that it is possible to add more information like dates and people to issues (and therefore cards). I would suggest that you use issues for anything related to your code.  

* Creating a card directly. This is going to be a ``text-only'' card with less functionality. This is useful for tasks related to your project, but not your code, for example signing forms. 

A card will usually start in the todo column. Then you can move it through different columns as you work on it. This is called a Kanban system. The idea is not to have too many cards in the ``in progress'' column, and to instead focus on getting a task done first, then moving on to the next. 

Here are some examples of Kanban systems used by researchers:
