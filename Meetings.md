# Meetings and communication

I would like to try working in a Scrum-type setup, but with modifications. If you haven't heard about scrum or cannot imagine how it could be used in a research lab, this post has a nice overview: https://rxqx.github.io/post/working-in-a-scrum-lab/

Borrowing from there and further modifying the setup to suit our needs, I would like to propose the following:

* We have a planning meeting with all lab members every month. Here we reflect how the previous month went, plan milestones for the next month, identify which parts could be shared between projects, and if so, plan meetings to develop those parts. I think this will be more efficient and will also help everybody (including myself) improve their project planning skills. 
	
* We have a "stand-up" meeting every week, where we update each other on our progress of that month's plan, the next thing we are planning to do, and any problems we run into. This will allow us to help each other overcome these problems. 
	
* You can schedule an individual meeting with me on request (I will try to create time slots which you can reserve)




Next to meetings, we will communicate mostly via email, Slack or Github. Email is for more official things, especially announcements within the IMAG/e group. If you need me to add something specific to my todo list (such as write a reference letter for you), email is best as well. Slack can be used for communication about projects, various announcements and short questions. When discussing code, it might be more effective to use Github directly, so that the discussion is kept alongside with the code. 

In general I will not reply in the evenings or weekends (and I don't expect you to either). However, I will keep an eye on my email/Slack if there are any pressing issues. If yes, I will probably answer with a delay since I have all notifications turned off. If there is a true emergency, you can contact me by phone (ask me at the next meeting for the number).
