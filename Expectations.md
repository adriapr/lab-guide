# Expectations

The goal of this document is to establish what I expect from you, and what you can expect from me. Having an understanding of our mutual expectations is key to the success of a student/supervisor relationship. 


## My expectations of you

* I expect that you will behave responsibly with your time. You should work on your project "full-time", but not more than that. For MSc and PhD projects this is roughly 36 hours per week, for BSc projects (10 ECTS, so 2/3 of your time) 24 hours per week. I do not expect you to spend all of that time at university. But, I expect that you will be in the lab at least some of the time that overlaps with others. If you need to take a day off (or spend a day using Facebook), remember to catch up on these hours another time.
	 
* I expect you to put your physical and mental health first. If you are having problems, please tell me about it. You do not need to tell me what is going on, but I will try to point you to places that can help. 
	 
* I expect you to be in charge of your project and keep track of what you need to do on a todo list. I can help you with information on how to best keep a todo list, but I cannot keep track of it for you. 
	 
* I expect that you will respect my time as I respect yours.  If we have a meeting scheduled, I expect you will be on time to let me know if you will be late. Prepare any materials (weekly meetings, drafts) in advance, at the agreed upon time. Add any tasks that come up during a meeting to your todo list. 
	 
* I expect that your project will be a combination of my research interests and your own ideas. To generate ideas, you will need to read papers related to your research questions, brainstorm, try things out etc. An annotated bibliography and a lab notebook are good places to keep track of all of this. 
	 
* I expect you to be resourceful and try to solve problems yourself first.  You will remember things better that way, and I may not have all the answers anyway. But do ask for help (me or others) when you cannot do it yourself - we might be able to help or point you in the right direction. 
	 
* I expect that you will work towards a project that can be used by others. Next to writing your thesis, document and share your code on Github. Consider creating an app, a toolbox, or a blog post with what you have learned. 
	 
* I expect you will discuss publications or talks with me before presenting/submitting. 
	 
* I expect that you will contribute to the group, by joining group meetings (and presenting or asking questions) and events, interacting with other students in the lab, etc. If you are doing a longer project, ask if you can contribute to general lab tasks.
	 
* If you are doing a longer project, I expect that you will ask my advice on issues related to your professional development (like choosing courses, research directions, leaving or staying in academia etc). I expect that you will consider that advice, but use your own judgement about taking it. I also encourage you to seek advice from other mentors. 


## Your expectations of me

* You can expect to meet with me approximately every week. If I am not able to be there, I will let you know in advance. If I am away, we might be able to meet via Skype. In between meetings, you can expect me to answer short questions on Slack. 

* You can expect me to be understanding if you are dealing with any physical or mental health problems, and if needed to point you to helpful resources.

* You can expect me to help you define an interesting research project and give you suggestions for related literature.

* You can expect me to try help when you have problems, or to point you in the direction where you might find answers.  

* You can expect me to give you feedback about your progress. You can expect me to provide feedback on your writing if you ask in advance (1-2 weeks).

* You can expect me to ask you for feedback about how I am doing as a supervisor. 

* If you are doing a longer project, you can expect me to work hard on helping you publish your work.

* You can expect me to alert you about interesting opportunities such as conferences, funding, jobs etc. You can expect me to give you advice on these topics, and to encourage you to find others who can give you advice.  

* You can expect me to write you letters of recommendation if you ask in advance (2 weeks).
