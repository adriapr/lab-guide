Our lab focuses on improving the use of machine learning methods in medical image analysis. On the one hand, this means developing methods which can learn from a limited amount of labeled data, such as multiple instance learning, transfer learning and crowdsourcing. On the other hand, this means evaluating whether these methods are reliable, and whether they generalize to other types of data. I want the lab to be a place where everybody is excited about the research with do, and how we do it. Although we will work on different projects, I think the key is to act as a team working towards a common goal of advancing medical imaging research. On the science side, this means focusing on the quality of the research, openly sharing our (positive and negative) results and contributing to the medical imaging research community. On the team side, this means supporting each other both with successes and failures, and motivating each other to be the best researchers and team members that we can be. To achieve this, I hope that as a lab we can do the following:
	
  * We search for important questions to answer, and not just to get state-of-the-art performance in an application.   
	* We read broadly and try to connect different parts of the literature to create new insights - often by brainstorming together.
	* We work together, share any successes or failures, and help each other out in case of problems
	* We work on creating things that others can use, both within and outside the lab. This means writing preprints or blog posts, sharing reproducible code with good documentation, and building up useful resources (such as a list of relevant literature, toolboxes, best practices etc).
	* We set deadlines for finishing the projects we work on, for example by submitting the work to a journal or conference. A project is successful if we are proud of the work we did and shared it with the rest of the world. Getting it accepted is a bonus. 
	* We take initiative and actively contribute to the lab, and suggest ways to improve the process further

This is somewhat different than the traditional model of one supervisor who communicates with each student individually, but the students projects do not overlap. In my opinion this is isolating for the students, and time-intensive for me as a supervisor. By pooling our knowledge and resources, I think we can work more effectively and efficiently. Think of us as a sports team - a team will only be successful if everybody works together, not if there's just one star player or coach.
