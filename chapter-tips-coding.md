# Coding

## General 

* In most cases, your code will be in Python and it will be in a Github repository

* Try things out with code early. Think about what the minimal setup is, for example loading a dataset, training a very simple classifier (or even just using random weights), testing the classifier on a new image and recording the results. 

* Do not reinvent everything yourself - search for examples and ask other students. Acknowledge sources if you use code from elsewhere. 

* Your code is going to be used by other people - your future self, other students, and myself. Document your code regularly, don't leave it until the end of your project

* Separate your methods (classifiers) from your experiments (which methods to test on which data, how many times). 

* Separate your parameters from your code. [To be continued]

## Github

Github is a way to version control your project and share your code (or anything text-based, like this guide!). If you have never ever heard of Github, you can watch a video on Youtube to get an idea what it does, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E

This means you can

	* Go back to previous versions if something you implemented isn’t working
	* Collaborate with other people on your code
	* Have other people use your code after your project is done!
	* Read about all the advantages (plus some tips) here: http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947


### Getting started 

1) Register for an account on github.com and send your username to your supervisor. This will allow me to fork this student project template for you into your own repository at tue-image, and add you there as a collaborator.

2) Once you received an invitation to your repository, explore the files a bit, try to edit them, etc. This guide has a good step by step procedure for this: https://lgatto.github.io/github-intro/ 


3) Check out some of these other resources if you need more help:

* Git for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/ During the installation, make sure to check the boxes “Add Git GUI here” and “Add Git Bash here”
* Tutorial: https://nathanj.github.io/gitguide/tour.html
* Another tutorial: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/git-on-windows-for-newbs--net-25847
* Interactive website: https://try.github.io/
Learn Github while on Github: https://lab.github.com/
* Github cheat sheet: https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf


The most important rule of Github is, it's normal that you don't understand everything at first! Start with functionality you are comfortable with, and go from here.
