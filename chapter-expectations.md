# Expectations

The goal of this document is to establish what I expect from you, and what you can expect from me. Having an understanding of our mutual expectations is key to the success of a student/supervisor relationship. 


## My expectations of you


* I expect you to put your physical and mental health first. If you are having problems, please tell me about it. You do not need to tell me what is going on, but I will try to point you to places that can help. 

* I expect that you will behave responsibly with your time. You should work on your project "full-time", but not more than that. For MSc and PhD projects this is roughly 36 hours per week, for BSc projects (10 ECTS, so 2/3 of your time) 24 hours per week. I do not expect you to spend all of that time at university. But, I expect that you will be in the lab at least some of the time that overlaps with others.	 
	 
* I expect you to be in charge of your project and keep track of what you need to do on a todo list. Add any tasks that come up during a meeting to your todo list. 
	 
* I expect that you will respect my time by preparing in advance for meetings (as agreed). There will be circumstances when this is not possible (such as illness), please try to let me know in advance. 

	 
* I expect that your project will be a combination of my research interests and your own ideas. To generate ideas, you will need to read papers related to your research questions, brainstorm, try things out etc. A lab notebook and an annotated bibliography will help with this. 
	 
* I expect you to try to solve problems yourself first, if you can, but to ask for help (me of others) if you need. 
	 
* I expect that you will work towards a project that can be used by others. Next to writing your thesis, document and share your code on Github. Consider creating an app, a toolbox, or a blog post with what you have learned. 
	 	 
* I expect that you will contribute to the lab and the larger IMAG/e group, by joining lab/group meetings (and presenting or asking questions) and events, interacting with other students, etc. If you are doing a longer project, ask if you can contribute to general lab/group tasks.
	 
* If you are doing a longer project, I expect that you will ask my advice on issues related to your professional development (like choosing courses, research directions, leaving or staying in academia etc). I expect that you will consider that advice, but use your own judgement about taking it. I also encourage you to seek advice from other mentors. 


## Your expectations of me


* You can expect me to be understanding if you are dealing with any physical or mental health problems, and if needed to point you to helpful resources.

* You can expect to meet with me approximately every week. If I am not able to be there, I will let you know in advance. If I am away, we might be able to meet via Hangouts. In between meetings, you can expect me to answer short questions on Slack. 

* You can expect me to help with tips on how to organize your project/todo-list, or point you in the direction where you can find more help - but I cannot keep track of it for you. 

* You can expect me to do what I say I will do (meet, give feedback, etc) at the time that we agreed. There will be circumstances in which this will not always be possible, but I will do my best to alert you about this in advance.  
 
* You can expect me to give you feedback about your progress. You can expect me to provide feedback on your writing, write you a recommendation letter, etc, if you ask in advance (1-2 weeks).

* You can expect me to help you define an interesting research project, give you suggestions for related literature and brainstorm with you about your topic. 

* You can expect me to ask you questions to help you figure out an answer, and/or point you in the direction of where you can find an answer. I do not have all the answers anyway :) 

* You can expect me to work hard on helping you publish your work and/or create something that other people can use. 

* You can expect me to work hard on improving how this lab/group works, and (if you are doing a longer project) to ask you to contribute to lab/group tasks. 

* If you are doing a longer project, you can expect me to alert you about interesting opportunities such as conferences, funding, jobs etc. You can expect me to give you advice on these topics, and to encourage you to find others who can give you advice.
