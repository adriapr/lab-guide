# Introduction

Hello! If you are here, probably you are doing a BSc/MSc/PhD project with me (Veronika). I'm excited to be working together! :sparkles:

This goal of this repository is to help you be successful as a student, and to help me be successful as a supervisor. 

Since I have just started writing this guide in January 2019, it is not yet complete. My hope for it is to cover the following topics:

* Onboarding - getting started with your project
* Expectations - what I expect from you and what you can expect from me
* Vision - my view on what we should research, and how to do it
* Lab organization - meetings, communication etc 
* Literature - papers I recommend that you read
* Tips - writing papers, giving presentations etc. 

This repository is meant to be a living thing which changes after each student project. I therefore invite any comments or suggestions (via pull requests or email).
