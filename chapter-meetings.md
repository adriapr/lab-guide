# Meetings and communication

## Meetings

There are 2 types of meetings every week:
* Meetings with the whole lab on Tuesday and Thursday, both at 11am 
* We have our individual meetings, which due to the lab meetings are probably going to be short.

There is also an IMAG/e-wide meeting which can be useful to attend, Espresso, on Thursdays at 4pm. You should receive weekly invitations with the speakers and the topic they will be presenting. 

## Meeting setup

During the lab meetings every Tuesday and Thursday we working according to the Scrum principle. Projects need to be defined by attainable, concrete and relatively small tasks. Use a verb in your task to make it more concrete, and think about what it means for a task to be done. Examples of good tasks are: "Read 3 papers on topic x", "implement method from paper x on dataset y", etc. 

Depending on the progress of the task, the task has a location on the Scrum board, in our of the four columns:

* Backlog - Long term task. This could be things want/need/plan to do, but not within the current Sprint 
* Do - Tasks that are not currently in progress but will be within the current Sprint 
* Doing - Tasks which are in progress
* Done - Tasks which are done

An important scrum principle is to work in so called 'spints'. Tasks should be defined for a period of 1-2 weeks, after which they should be completed. Then a new set of tasks should be defined. Given this principle our scrum meetings on Tuesday and Thursday have different functions. 

### Tuesday 11am
* Discuss the progress of the current tasks
* Move tasks into the Do and doing part of the board
* Move tasks to Done
* Add tasks to the Backlog

### Thursday 11am
* Discuss the progress of the current tasks
* No new tasks should be moved into "Do" or "Doing"
* Move tasks to Done
* Add task to the Backlog

## Communication
Next to meetings, we will communicate mostly via email, Slack, Github or Evernote:

1. Email is for more official things, especially announcements within the IMAG/e group. If you need me to add something specific to my todo list (such as write a reference letter for you), email is best as well. 

2. Slack can be used for communication about projects, various announcements and short questions. 

3. Github (issues) might be more effective to use Github directly, so that the discussion is kept alongside with the code. 

4. Evernote can be used to share files with each other. Meeting minutes, literature, reports and other documents useful to the lab can be found here. 

In general Veronika will tend not reply in the evenings or weekends (and I don't expect you to either). However, she does check her email in case there are any pressing issues. If there is a true emergency, you can contact her by phone (see Evernote for the number).
