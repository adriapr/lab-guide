# Meetings and communication

## Meetings

There are 2 types of meetings every week:
* Meetings with the whole lab on Tuesday at 11am 
* We have our individual meetings, which due to the lab meetings are probably going to be short.

Projects need to be defined by attainable, concrete and relatively small tasks. Use a verb in your task to make it more concrete, and think about what it means for a task to be done. Examples of good tasks are: "Read 3 papers on topic x", "implement method from paper x on dataset y", etc. 

Every 6-8 weeks we define a list of tasks for ourselves. Then every meeting, we give a progress report on what has been done (possibly including results) and what needs to be done next. 

There is also an IMAG/e-wide meeting which can be useful to attend, Espresso, on Thursdays at 4pm. 


## Communication
Next to meetings, we will communicate mostly via email, Slack or Github:

1. Email is for more official things, especially announcements within the IMAG/e group. If you need me to add something specific to my todo list (such as write a reference letter for you), email is best as well. 

2. Slack can be used for communication about projects, various announcements and short questions. 

3. Github (issues) might be more effective to use Github directly, so that the discussion is kept alongside with the code. 

In general Veronika will tend not reply in the evenings or weekends (and doesn't expect you to either). However, she does check her email in case there are any pressing issues. If there is a true emergency, you can contact her by phone (see Evernote for the number).
