# Meetings and communication

## Meetings

There are 2 types of meetings every week:
* Meetings with the whole lab on Tuesday and Thursday, both at 11am 
* We have our individual meetings, which due to the lab meetings are probably going to be short.

During the lab meetings every Tuesday and Thursday we working according to the Scrum principle. Projects need to be defined by attainable, concrete and relatively small tasks. Use a verb in your task to make it more concrete, and think about what it means for a task to be done. Examples of good tasks are: "Read 3 papers on topic x", "implement method from paper x on dataset y", etc. 

Depending on the progress of the task, the task has a location on the Scrum board, in our of the four columns:

* Backlog - Long term task. This could be things want/need/plan to do, but not within the current Sprint 
* Do - Tasks that are not currently in progress but will be within the current Sprint 
* Doing - Tasks which are in progress
* Done - Tasks which are done

The current setup of the lab meetings is:

### Tuesday 11am
* Discuss the progress of the current tasks
* Create and plan tasks and shift tasks accross the board

### Thursday 11am
* Discuss the progress of the current tasks
* No new tasks should be moved into "Do" or "Doing"
* Tasks for the backlog can be added at any time. 

There is also an IMAG/e-wide meeting which can be useful to attend, Espresso, on Thursdays at 4pm. 


## Communication
Next to meetings, we will communicate mostly via email, Slack or Github:

1. Email is for more official things, especially announcements within the IMAG/e group. If you need me to add something specific to my todo list (such as write a reference letter for you), email is best as well. 

2. Slack can be used for communication about projects, various announcements and short questions. 

3. Github (issues) might be more effective to use Github directly, so that the discussion is kept alongside with the code. 

In general Veronika will tend not reply in the evenings or weekends (and I don't expect you to either). However, she does check her email in case there are any pressing issues. If there is a true emergency, you can contact her by phone (see Evernote for the number).
