# Writing

There is a lot of writing in research! You will often hear me say to write early, and write often. In this part I explain what that means. 

## Taking notes

* Take notes in your lab notebook. Document what you've read about, what you thought about it, what you might have done differently. If trying out experiments, write down what worked and what didn't. It seems counterintuitive but this will help you come up with new ideas, and will speed up the process when you sit down to write your thesis or a paper.
* If summarizing a paper, get into the habit of already paraphrasing the text - if you plan to do this later you can forget about it, which is dangerous.


## Software

* Use LateX. You can use Overleaf, which integrates with Git if you want to have an offline copy. Another option for offline work is described here: https://www.win.tue.nl/latex/windows.html (only if you are on the TUE network). 
* Use Bibtex for your references. You can manage Bibtex files with Jabref or Zotero. With Overleaf you can have one .bib file which you access from multiple projects, I have written a blog post about this here: https://veronikach.com/phd-advice/multiple-overleaf-projects-with-a-single-bib-file/
* Next to your own .bib file, you can (in Overleaf) add mine via https://www.dropbox.com/s/g17zns4gploqk4c/refs_main.bib?dl=1 which will save time with formatting. 


## Structure / Style

Writing easy-to-read, concise and convincing papers is difficult and takes practise. I am still learning this as well - reading papers, and reading books about writing helps. Since such books are out there (I will add a few I recommend as this guide develops), I cannot summarize everything you need to know here. However, here are a few tips: 

* Read papers from the journal / conference you want to submit to, to become familiar with the typical structure
* Follow the rules of the journal / conference
* Use active voice (we) 
* Avoid paragraphs or sentences that are too long
* When reading the first sentence of every paragraph, a coherent story should form

* Do not capitalize regular words, such as deep learning
* Check that all acronyms are defined first 
* Be consistent, for example "finetuning" vs "fine-tuning"
* Tables and figures should be readable stand-alone, and ideally should still be readable in black-and-white format
* Tidy up your references to be consistent, remove any unnecessary words like "Proceedings of the third". Use my .bib file for examples.
